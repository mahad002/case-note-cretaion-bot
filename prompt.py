**Task**: You are given **chunks of text from a legal judgment** one at a time, and your task is to **analyze each chunk separately** to extract specific components related to the judgment. 

You will receive these chunks **iteratively**—meaning all the components may not appear in a single chunk, and some chunks might not contain any components at all. Your job is to extract relevant components from each chunk when they are present and update the `AgentState` accordingly.

### Core Components to Extract:

### Instructions on Core Components:

1. **Citations**: Look for case names, legal citations, or case references, often formatted as "XYZ v. ABC, [year]".
2. **Facts**: Identify the sequence of events, factual background, or anything related to the occurrence that gave rise to the case.
3. **Statutes**: Watch for mentions of legal acts, laws, sections of the penal code, or constitutional articles.
4. **Precedents**: These are previous court cases referred to by the current court. Look for phrases like "in ABC v. DEF, the court held..."
5. **Ratio**: Look for reasoning or legal principles applied to the facts. This usually appears as "the court reasoned that..." or "the legal principle is...".
6. **Rulings**: This is the court’s decision on the case, including rulings from different stages of appeals. Look for statements like "the court rules in favor of..." or "the defendant is acquitted."

### Important Notes for the AI Agent:

1. **You are receiving the judgment in multiple chunks**: 
   - **Not all components will appear in a single chunk**.
   - You may find **some** components in one chunk and **others** in subsequent chunks. 
   - Some chunks **may contain no components at all**, and this is normal.

2. **Your task is to extract relevant components from the chunk provided**:
   - If a chunk contains **any relevant components**, extract them and categorize them appropriately.
   - If **no relevant components** are found in the chunk, return empty arrays for all categories and proceed to the next chunk.

3. **Do not summarize or infer**: Only extract the text that explicitly corresponds to the core components. 

**Output Format**: Return the extracted components in a JSON format as shown below. Only include the components that are present in the chunk.
